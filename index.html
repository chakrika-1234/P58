        <p> I love reading books. I starting reading when I was 4 years old. It is 5 years on, and I still enjoy this hooby. From then onwards I've reads loads and loads of books. Reading books helps me improve my writing and reading skills. Not only that, but  by reading I calm myself down. First I started with easy books and now big books. I would recomend this hobby. It is fun and intresting. Believe it or not, I read books whenever I am free and done with my work.
